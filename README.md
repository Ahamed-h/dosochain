```

## 🚀 Features
- Doctor registration with **public/private key pairs**
- Prescription issuing with **ECDSA digital signatures**
- **Proof of Authority** consensus for block mining
- **Merkle Tree** for transaction verification
- Blockchain explorer to view prescriptions

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used
- SHA-256 Hashing → Prescription immutability  
- ECDSA Digital Signatures → Doctor authentication  
- Proof of Authority Consensus → Block validation  
- Merkle Tree Algorithm → Fast verification  
- Time-stamping → Tracking prescription issuance  

## 📦 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahamed-h/dosochain.git
cd dosochain
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
▶️ Usage
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
